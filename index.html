            I am currently a senior attending Dougherty Valley High School in San Ramon, California. I was born in Chicago in 1999 on September 28th. As of the last update of this website, I am 18 years old and looking to get into a good college. After being born in Chicago, I spent a few years in China living with my grandma in ShangHai and moved back to Chicago at around age 5. Then around 3rd grade, I moved to California and have lived the rest of my life in California.</p>

                       I've been on my school's badminton team for two of the three full years that I have been at DVHS. The one year I didn't join was because I had classes that conflicted with the training time. During these years, I have gotten a lot better and have become much better friends with everyone on the team. I also earned the Most Improved Player award in my sophmore year.</p>

                       While I only played during freshman year, I really liked football. I played as both a defensive back and a wide reciever on our freshman team. I did not ever make it to varsity because I quit football due to class preferences. During my fresman year we went 7-7-1, and I was able to get an interception on defence. Ironically, even though I started on both offence and defence, that interception was the only time I was able to catch the football.</p>

                       I helped start this club at my school in my sophmore year seeing the amount of stress that the kids at my school were going through. We are a club that is dedicated to bring out the good inside of people: having our club memebers do kind actions for people that we do not know.</p>
